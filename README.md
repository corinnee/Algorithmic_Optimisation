### Applications of Evolutionary Algorithms in Astrophysics

#### Abstract
This document explores the application of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in solving complex scheduling problems in astrophysics. Specifically, it discusses how EAs can efficiently schedule the target observations of telescopes, both ground-based observatories and space-based telescopes. The paper provides insights into candidate solutions, fitness functions, and the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.

## Algorithmic Trading Optimization

### Trading Strategies Optimization with Genetic Algorithms

#### Project Description
This project focuses on optimizing trading strategies based on technical analysis using Genetic Algorithms. It involves the implementation of technical indicators and trading signals to optimize trading strategies for Unilever stock. The project comprises two parts: Part A involves implementing technical indicators in R, while Part B utilizes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach implemented in Java to optimize trading signals based on the technical indicators.
